# Remik — Polish Rummy

A modern, high-performance implementation of the classic Polish Rummy (Remik) card game, built with Vite and Vanilla JavaScript. Play against a challenging AI opponent with smooth animations and an intuitive interface.

## 🃏 About the Game

Remik is a popular Polish variant of Rummy played with two full decks and Jokers. The objective is to be the first to get rid of all your cards by forming valid sequences and groups (melds).

### Key Features
- **Single Player vs AI**: Play against a strategic AI opponent.
- **Smooth UI & Animations**: High-quality card movements and interactive elements.
- **Save & Resume**: Your game state is automatically saved, allowing you to pick up where you left off.
- **Customizable Experience**: Organize and lock your cards for better strategy.
- **Rich Aesthetics**: A premium, responsive design with polished typography and dark patterns.

## 🚀 Future Plans
While currently a solo experience, Remik is designed with modularity in mind. Future updates are planned to introduce **Multiplayer functionality**, allowing you to compete with friends online.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ESM)
- **Bundler**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
